The Sequential Wave Imprinting Machine (SWIM),
   invented by Steve
   Mann in the 1970s, offers naked-eye augmented reality overlays
   with perfect alignment,
   through a Persistence of Exposure (PoE) of human vision,
   or photographic/videographic media.

   This paper proposes a 
   new SWIM design with only 2 transistor elements per picture elment,
   therefore making SWIM more wearable, miniature, and affordable.
   We present a SWIM for being worn on one finger, as a ring, to overlay
   a phenomenologically augmented reality for metaveillance
   (sensing sensors and sensing their capacity to sense).
