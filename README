==============

Adnan
- go through each sentence and write in english
  * incorporate all references from bibtex
  * include figs from scans
  * include scope pictures
- write conclusion


Pete
- get scope pics of 10 transistor design
- pics of circuits

=== SUBMIT

- write analysis w/ Pete
- write why power supply shouldn't need a power supply
- efficiency calculations or measurements
  * we have conduction losses, but not switching losses

-say that 2 terminal AC version is good for universal AC indicators.
- emphasize as discrete transistor designs, as opposed to designs based on op amps or other chips.
 * what about saying that for an application like this, discrete transistor approach will work well enough and be cheaper than alternatives.. I dunno, have to think about this more


=== DONE
